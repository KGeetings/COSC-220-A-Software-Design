    /* Add a Guess class that will keep information about a single guess. 
    The instance variables for this class should be an x and y location (or row, column), 
    a Boolean value that indicates if the guess was successful or not, and another int that is the distance that guess is from a hotspot. 
    The class only needs to have a single constructor which takes parameters for each of the instance variables and “accessor” methods 
    for each of the instance variables which returns the value of that instance variable. */
